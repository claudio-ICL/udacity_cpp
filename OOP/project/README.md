# CppND-System-Monitor

My implementation of the system monitor developed from the starter code available at [https://github.com/udacity/CppND-System-Monitor](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-System-Monitor). See also  [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). 

Go to `./CppND-System-Monitor/README.md` for a more detailed readme with build instructions relying on `make`.
